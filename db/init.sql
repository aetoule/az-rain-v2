This is Bailey! She came to me Thanksgiving evening 2017, at one of my feeding stations outside at my Apt complex. She tried to eat, but was having difficulties. I was able to pick her up, carry her to me bathroom and schedule a vet appointment. 
Bailey had severe stomatitis. All her teeth have been pulled. Ten weeks later, she’s recovered, eats dry and wet food, with no teeth! I think she’s doesn’t see well out of her left eye, but is fine seeing out of her right eye. She walks fine and beginning to jump up onto my couch with no problems. 
The Vet thinks she’s about 6 yrs old, has spent most of her life fighting off other outside cats outside. One of the maintenance men, told me she was always alone, and lived under a bush, even in the heat of summer. She has tested negative for FeLV and FIV Dec 2017. 
She loves to sleep in her own kitty bed. She likes to come out of the bathroom to roam. When she hears my voice, she comes to me. 
I believe she needs a nice peaceful life now. To be adored as she should have been the first six years of her life. Its not fair to Bailey to live with all my other cats and not feel safe. This is the reason I’m hoping to find a wonderful home for Miss Bailey.

Can be a little shy at first but once she chooses you it’s a forever bond. Loves to knead her paws to find a comfortable spot to lay on and snuggle. Usually on a lap and stomach before she sprawls out. Loves her tummy rubbed and both sides of her neck and face. My favorite is when she will sit on the back rest of the couch and perch her two front paws on my shoulder and rub her head against my neck. She’s a sweetheart. If you’re interested in a pair check out her brother Beanz!

She is a shy kitty who gets nervous in new places, filled with noises and people she doesn’t know. She was a wonderful mother to her 3 babies who she had at a young age, after being dumped in the desert while very pregnant, but she found a shelter in a street drainage on Loop 202 where she delivered and cared for her babies where she was surrounded by desert full of predators, right on extremely busy street until they were rescued. She is a hardcore mama that survived the hot summer with little food and water and saved all her babies as well. Mom of the year award goes to Ellie! She is ready now for her forever home where she can live her life save and loved. Because of her past she is very timid and will need a special family that understands her needs and will give her patience to adjust at her own pace. She would do best in a home with no kids.'),
